\***   PSS37 is designed to run concurrently with PSS38. PSS38 handles      ***
\***   all asyncronous communications with a connected LDT/PDT. All data    ***
\***   sent by the LDT/PDT is passed to PSS37 via PSS38 by means of a       ***

\***   PSS37 validates the data sent to ensure the data has been sent in    ***
\***   the correct sequence, has a valid format and is meaningful.          ***
\***   There are basically two processes PSS37 performs to either an LDT    ***
\***   or PDT;                                                              ***

\***   The PDT now runs three applications - EPSOM, CSR and PRICE CHECK.    ***
\***   Both PSS37 and PSS38 are being altered to cope with the two extra    ***

\***   will be passed to the program to indicate the port being monitored.  ***
\***   NB.  Because the original program referred to "lists" this has been  ***
\***   left to mean EPSOM lists; CSR lists will be "CSR lists".             ***

\***   (DIRSUP) and the Direct Orders File (DIRORD).  When receipts are     ***
\***   passed back to the controller PSS37 will write receipts information  ***

\***   REVISION 2.0      David Artiss                       27th May 2003   ***
\***   During the testing of version 1.9 of this code there were problems   ***
\***   with the fact that the code kept running out of session numbers to   ***
\***   allocate. This I got around by allocating certain files only when    ***
\***   entering the appropriate module and then deallocating on exit.       ***
\***   However, this problem has persisted in the live environment. To      ***
\***   this end I have improved this by allocating/deallocating more files  ***
\***   as well as the fact that I've commented out reference to STKCF       ***
\***   which doesn't seem to be used any more.                              ***
\***                                                                        ***

\***   There are still potential problems due to the large number of        ***
\***   files that this program uses.                                        ***
\***   Module 1 contains a lot of code for the old CSR transmissions        ***
\***   system which is no longer used. In fact now that the PDT6100 has     ***
\***   rolled out the function is not even accessable anymore. This code    ***
\***   should be removed and this will also free up a lot of extra files.   ***

\***   Other Credit Claim is being changed so that items not on file are    ***

\***   from the claim and added to the rejection file).  Also instead of    ***
\***   PSS37 creating the rejection report, the information is now written  ***
\***   out to a new credit claim rejection file CCREJ.  If any items have   ***
\***   been rejected the PSS25 is started via ADXSTART                      ***
\***   Goods out has been changed to be in line with Other Credit claiming  ***
\***   Items that are for invalid Business Centres are rejected from the    ***
\***   claims and added to the rejection file                               ***
\***   Items where the item qty x the item value is > £9,999.99 will have   ***

\***   If a new flag on SOFTS record 43 shows that all rejections are req   ***
\***   then if the item business centre does not match the claim business   ***
\***   centre this item will be removed from the claim and a record added   ***
