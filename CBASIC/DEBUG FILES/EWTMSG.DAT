0200 EXTRACT Version 3.00
0201
0202 This program will extract a failed application's memory and related
0203 information from a full dump into a file named APPLDUMP for examination
0204 with the Toshiba 4680/4690 Application Dump Tool (DEBUGDMP).
0205
0206 The formats of the command are as follows:
0207
0208   EXTRACT system type -Q<uery>     // Lists the appls in the dump   
0209
0210   EXTRACT system type PROC=name    // Dumps an application by name
0211
0212   EXTRACT system type PID=hexnum   // Dumps an appl by PID (process ID)
0213
0214   EXTRACT system type NODE=xx DIR=dir // Dumps the current process to DIR 
0215 where:                                                            
0216     system = 4680 (for 4680 Ctrl dump or 4680 Terminal HARDWARE dump)
0217              4690 (for 4690 Ctrl dump of 4690 Terminal HARDWARE dump)
0218     type = T<erminal> or C<ontroller>
0219     xx = node on the LAN (optional)
0220     name = process name               // use -Q option to find this
0221     hexnum = process id               // use -Q option to find this
0222     dir = directory where APPLDUMP file is created (optional)
0223

0225 The previous error may have been caused by entering EXTRACT 4680 ...
0226 on a 4690 type dump.
