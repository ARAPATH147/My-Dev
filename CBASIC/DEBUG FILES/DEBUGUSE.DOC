  The 4680/4690 APPLICATION DEBUGGER is a debugger for 4680/4690 BASIC and C    
  application programs running under 4680/4690 OS Version 2 Release 1 CD 9001   
  Delta 3 or later.  The debugger is designed to help speed up program develop- 
  ment and 4680/4690 debugging. The 4680/4690 Application Debugger allows:

  o   Debugging an application dump file (Note 3.)                              
                                                                                
  o   Debugging controller or terminal application programs                     
                                                                                
  o   Debugging foreground or background controller applications                
                                                                                
  o   Debugging on line or off line terminal applications                       
                                                                                
  o   Setting break points, single stepping, changing variables by name, and    
      displaying the function call trace                                        
                                                                                
  o   Displaying the contents of 4680/4690 pipes, application screen, or pro-   
      gram's load segments                                                      
                                                                                
  o   Displaying your application in the source language or in the resultant    
      assembler code.                                                           
                                                                                
  NOTE:  1. Enhanced Debugger Functions such as array support, local variables, 
  and automatic type definitions are not available with the 4680/4690 BASIC     
  prior to Version 3.                                                           
                                                                                
  NOTE:  2. Application development can be on OS/2, DOS, or 4680/4690.          
  DEBUGDMP.EXE will run on OS/2 only.  DEBUGFRM.EXE and DEBUGCDV.EXE will run   
  on DOS or OS/2.  DEBUGFRM.286 and DEBUGCDV.286 will run on 4680/4690.  To     
  compile and link BASIC on OS/2 refer to Appendix G, "Information for OS/2     
  Users" on page 48 for information.                                            
                                                                                
  NOTE:  3. The debug dump feature allows the examination of terminal or con-   
  troller dump files.  It allows you to determine what applications were        
  running when a controller or terminal dump occurred.  This is invaluable when 
  a dump was taken because of an application hang.  The dump can be analyzed to 
  determine where it was executing and what the variables were. This feature    
  will enhance your debugging ability and reduce development time.  Version 3.0 
  of the Debugger adds support for 4690 Operating System dumps.  Refer to       
  "Using the Application Debug Dump Feature" on page 28 for more information.

  features will be limited.  There will be no local variable or array support.  
                                                                                
                                                                                
  INSTALLATION                                                                  
                                                                                
  The debugger install program creates debugger logical names.  Therefore, the  
  debugger will not operate correctly unless the install program is used.  For  
  installation instructions, refer to the README.DOC on the installation        
  diskette. The complete debugger is available on two diskettes. To install,    
  insert the first debugger diskette in the A: drive and type A:INSTALL.

  Two versions of the 4680/4690 BASIC Compiler are available.  BASIC Compiler   
  versions prior to 3.0 limit debugger function.                                
                                                                                
  Use the BAS.BAT file. included on the debugger diskette, to prepare BASIC     
  programs for debugging or use these five steps. A detailed explanation        
  follows.

  1.  "BASIC filename [ DF... ]" to compile a filename.BAS file.  The "D"       
      option generates debug information within the .OBJ file and the "F"       
      option saves the listing file. The listing file is used in the next step. 
                                                                                
      NOTE:  1.Versions of 4680/4690 BASIC prior to version 3, requires the     
      following syntax for compiling:                                           
                                                                                
      o   "BASIC filename [VF]"                                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
      NOTE:  2.If you do not have executable code in include files, your com-   
      piler syntax becomes "BASIC filename [DG... ]" and the DEBUGFRM step is   
      not needed. If DEBUGFRM is not run the debugger will use the .BAS file as 
      a listing file instead of the .LCV file.                                  
  2.  "DEBUGFRM filename nn" where nn is the read buffer size of 1 to 31        
      Kbytes, the default is 16K bytes. This operation adjusts the listing file 
      for the debugger and creates a filename.LCV file. This LCV file will      
      serve as the source file during debug.  DEBUGFRM must be run on each      
      listing file / object file.

  3.  "LINK86 filename [S,M,DBI]" to Link and create a filename.286 file. (Note 
      3) This operation creates the .MAP, .LIN and .SYM files for DEBUGCDV.     
      The S option instructs LINK86 to search the library and only link         
      externally referenced modules.  The M option creates the .MAP file.  The  
      DBI option creates the necessary information for the debugger.  The load  
      module can be shared or not shared.  Do not use the NOLIN option.  The    
      NOLIN option used with the DBI option causes no line numbers to be gener- 
      ated.  The debugger needs line numbers. Do not use the MAP[ALL] option or 
      map the shared runtimes.                                                  
                                                                                
      NOTE:  Don't use the DBI option with versions of 4680/4690 BASIC prior to 
      Version 3. The previous compiler requires the following syntax for        
      linking:                                                                  
                                                                                
      o   "LINK86 filename [S,M]"                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
      NOTE:  If you are using .INP files to combine .OBJ and/or .L86 modules,   
      select the DBI option on the first .OBJ file in the .INP file.  Once the  
      DBI option is set on in an .INP file, it will remain on for the rest of   
      the file.  Refer to the the IBM Store System Programming Guide for more   
      information.                                                              
                                                                                
      NOTE:  All terminal programs must be post linked.                         
  4.  "DEBUGCDV filename /F" to create a filename.CDV file required for debug-  
      ging. The /F option is used to make the .CDV file generation faster while 
      losing additional global type information.                                
                                                                                
      NOTE:  Don't have the same .OBJ name in a library and the file list.      
  5.  "POSTLINK filename " to create a postlinked filename.286 file required    
      for debugging.                                                            
  6.  "DEBUG filename" to start the debugger. Filename refers to the .286 name  
      created by the previous operations.  The debugger will require the .286,  
      .CDV, and source or .LCV files.  Refer to "Starting DEBUG" on page 6 for  
      information on options and arguments.

      COMPILING C PROGRAMS FOR DEBUGGING                                        
                                                                                
      The only C compiler supported by the Application Debugger is the Meta     
      Ware (R)** High C (R) Compiler 1.7 available through Integrated Systems,  
      Inc. (R)**.                                                               
                                                                                
      Use the MW.BAT file, included on the 4680/4690 Application Debugger       
      diskette or use the following 4 steps to prepare C code for debugging:    
                                                                                
      1.  "HC filename -mm big -DEBUG -ON CODEVIEW -OFF OPTIMIZE_XJMP -OFF      
          OPTIMIZE_FP -OFF OPTIMIZE_XJMP_SPACE"                                 
      2.  "LINK86 filename [S,M,DBI],HCBE.L86[S]"                               
      3.  "DEBUGCDV filename"                                                   
      4.  "POSTLINK filename"                                                   
      5.  "DEBUG filename"                                                      
                                                                                
      A detailed explanation of the four steps follows:                         
                                                                                
      1.  "HC filename -mm big -DEBUG - ON CODEVIEW -OFF OPTIMIZE_XJMP -OFF     
          OPTIMIZE_FP -OFF OPTIMIZE_XJMP_SPACE" to compile a filename.C file.   
          The "-mm big option uses the BIG memory model for compiling.  The     
          "-DEBUG" and -ON CODEVIEW options provides support for the debugger.  
          The -OFF OPTIMIZE_... options turn off optimization features that are 
          confusing while debugging. For your production level compile using    
          optimization options can significantly enhance the performance of     
          your program.  The DEBUG and ON CODEVIEW options should be turned on  
          for your final compile. This will support codeview data for use with  
          the DEBUG DUMP feature of the debugger.                               
      2.  "LINK86 filename [S,M,DBI],HCBE.L86[S]" to Link and create a          
          filename.286 file.  This operation creates the MAP, LIN and SYM files 
          for the DEBUGCDV operation.  The S option instructs LINK86 to search  
          the library and only link externally referenced modules.  The M       
          option creates the MAP file.  The DBI option creates the necessary    
          information for the debugger.  The HCBE is linked in for the BIG      
          memory model.  If you are using an .INP file, make sure that the      
          these options are included.                                           
      3.  "DEBUGCDV filename" to create a filename.CDV file required for debug- 
          ging.                                                                 
      4.  "DEBUG filename" to start the debugger. Filename refers to the 286    
          name created by the previous operations. The debugger will require    
          the source, .CDV and .286 files.  Refer to "Starting DEBUG" on page 6 
          for information on options and arguments.                             
                                                                                
      NOTE:  If you are using .INP files to combine .OBJ and /or .L86 modules,  
      select the DBI option on the first .OBJ file in the .INP file. Refer to   
      the the IBM Store System Programming Guide for more information.

          STARTING DEBUG                                                        
                                                                                
          The debugger must be able to find the .286, .CDV, and source files to 
          function correctly.  If you used BAS.BAT or the "F" BASIC compiler    
          option and executed DEBUGFRM, the .LCV file serves as the BASIC       
          source file.  (Note 2) The .286 and .CDV files must be in the same    
          subdirectory.                                                         
                                                                                
          The debugger start command syntax is:

          FILENAME:       is the name of the 286 file you wish to debug.        
                                                                                
                          The 286, source files and CDV file must be available  
                          to the debugger.  For BASIC code the LCV file serves  
                          as the source file.  The debugger will always search  
                          for a file with .LCV to use as the source file.  The  
                          debugger searches for your program's source files in  
                          this order:                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                 Using DEBUG  6

          ARGUMENTS:      is the standard input character strings passed to the 
                          program.                                              
                                                                                
          NOTE:  1.If you are debugging a background or terminal application,   
          you must enter the full path name. The  Background or Terminal appli- 
          cation will load its program from the file name specified. If you     
          enter only the file name, the loader assumes the file is in the root  
          directory.                                                            
                                                                                
          The filename plus the path is limited to 21 characters.  If your ter- 
          minal program files (ie. terminal.286) are in a subdirectory called   
          TESTFILE, you need to create a logical name for the subdirectory.     
          For example:                                                          
                                                                                
            DEBUG /T123 /M C:\TESTFILE\TERMINAL                                 
                                                                                
          This will not work because the system adds the .286 extension and     
          exceeds the 21 character limit.  To correct this, create a system     
          logical name of TEST: to define C:\TESTFILE\, then your syntax        
          becomes:                                                              
                                                                                
            DEBUG /T123 /M TEST:TERMINAL                                        
                                                                                
          NOTE:  2.Use the DEBUGSRC environment variable for source files not   
          in the same directory as the .CDV and .286 files or if the directory  
          is not in the path.  For example, if your source is contained in      
          C:$MYPROG$SRC and your .CDV and .286 files are in C:$MYPROG$OBJ, and  
          if $MYPROG$SRC is not in the path and is not the current directory,   
          then you should set the DEBUGSRC environment variable to              
          C:$MYPROG$SRC before invoking DEBUG.  To set or reset this environ-   
          ment variable:                                                        
                                                                                
            DEFINE DEBUGSRC = C:$MYPROG$SRC                                     
                                                                                
          Remember that the DEBUGFRM operation creates a filename.LCV file      
          which the debugger uses as the source file for 4680/4690 BASIC files. 
                                                                                
          NOTE:  3.You must have the source code and .CDV file for the debug    
          initialization or start-up code option to work.

          THE DEBUGGER SCREEN                                                   
                                                                                
          The debugger screen consists of an action bar across the top, a body  
          containing the source or assembler code, and a status line(s) across  
          the bottom.  Context sensitive help is available on all screens by    
          pressing F1 for a help screen.                                        
                                                                                
          The action bar is a set of pull-down windows to assist you with the   
          functions available in DEBUG. It is accessed by pressing F10.  Then   
          you can highlight the desired option using the arrow keys.  Pressing  
          ENTER will activate the highlighted options.  Pressing F1 displays a  
          help screen for the highlighted option.                               
                                                                                
          The body or center of the screen displays the source or assembler     
          code being debugged. The reverse video line is the next line to be    
          executed.  Executable source lines are highlighted; comment lines are 
          not. A breakpoint is represented by an underline or the color red,    
          depending on your display configuration.  An overlay memory window    
          can be selected to display on the source screen near the top.         
                                                                                
          The status line(s) are across the bottom. On the source screen, a     
          single line displays the name of the source file being debugged.  The 
          line below the source file name is the message line. Any system       
          message or variable value is displayed on the message line.  On the   
          assembler screen, the file name line and the message line display the 
          same data.  Above these lines are the two lines that display the      
          processor register and flags. The registers display in hexadecimal    
          and flag values display in binary.

                This is an executable line (at source- or machine-level).

              example, if you use a backslash in 4680/4690 BASIC to extend a    
              statement to several lines, the debugger will only show the first 
              line as code.

          on active keys. )                                                     
                                                                                
          Selections are available from the action bar. Use F10 to access the   
          action bar functions. The action bar functions can be used by         
          pressing the capitol letter in the action bar item name. An example   
          to restart the application without exiting the debugger is: press "C" 
          for commands, "A" for restart application, and "Y" for yes to

          The debugger can only display the variables it know about.  All vari- 
          ables, formal parameters, and labels declared within a module are     
          local to that module.  They are unknown or undefined outside of that  
          module.                                                               
                                                                                
          Refer to the IBM 4680/4690 BASIC Language Reference under the heading 
          "Scope of Data" or your favorite programming manual for more informa- 
          tion on the scope of variables.                                       
                                                                                
          Formulas and expressions can have variable names, provided they are   
          known to the debugger.  The variables that are known by the debugger  
          depends on the compiler used.                                         
                                                                                
          Using the IBM 4680/4690 BASIC compiler prior to Version 3, only the   
          global variables and functions are known to debugger.  If you have    
          BASIC Version 3 or later and experience this problem, check your      
          compile options.  Refer to "Compiling 4680/4690 BASIC programs for    
          debugging" on page 3 for information.                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
          NOTE:  You can select variables to view or watch in the storage       
          window with the ShowVarPtsTo(*), PutVarInStg(INS), and                
          PutVarPtsToInStg(Ctrl+Ins) functions.  These functions work on non-   
          executable and executable lines.  To view a variable use the          
          ShowVar(=) function. This will display the variable on the bottom     
          line of the display.

                                                                Using DEBUG  21 

                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
          When the debugger checks a formula, variable or parameter name, it    
          evaluates addresses. Register names evaluate to the contents of the   
          named register. Constants evaluate to integers.  A formula yields an  
          address only if a segment is given (for example, ss:sp) or implied    
          through use of a variable or parameter name.  Formulas with no        
          segment (for example, ax+1) yield scalar values.                      
                                                                                
          Parentheses are not allowed in formulas and all operators have equal  
          precedence.  Expressions are evaluated from left to right except      
          pointer de-reference operator which is done last (for example, it     
          applies to the address specified by the rest of the formula).         
                                                                                
          The previous formula interpretation differs from the way that the C   
          language interprets expressions.  For example, using the debugger, if 
          array is an array of characters, array+2 refers to the second byte    
          beyond array (as in C), and i+2. refers to the second byte beyond i   
          (the C interpretation of i+2 is the value of i plus 2).               
                                                                                
          Although the area of the display devoted to the formula provides only 
          a 10 character field, you may type expressions up to 80 characters    
          long.  When you press ENTER, the display field will be truncated to   
          10 characters, but the displayed value will still be correct.  To see 
          the full underlying formula, move the cursor to that line and press   
          the left or right cursor key.                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
          NUMERIC CONSTANTS IN DEBUGGER EXPRESSIONS                             
                                                                                
          Numbers are treated by the debugger as either decimal or hexadecimal  
          in expressions parsed by the debugger.  The rules are as follows:     
                                                                                
          1.  An "0x" forces the number to be treated as hexadecimal.  For      
              example, the number "0x10" is hexadecimal 10 (decimal 16).        
                                                                                
          2.  Any number appearing in an expression that contains a colon (":") 
              is treated as hexadecimal.  For example, in the following         
              expression                                                        
                                                                                
                 47:5c+4                                                        
                                                                                
               both 5c and 4 are treated as hex.                                
                                                                                
          3.  Any other number is treated as a decimal number.  For example,    
              the expression "alphabet[25]" treats the 25 as a decimal sub-     
              script.

          The debugger displays several variable types in default formats.  You 
          can change the display format for each variable.  See "Data Display   
          Format Options" on page 25 for information.  The default formats are:

          ARRAY SUPPORT                                                         
                                                                                
          The 4680/4690 Application Debugger supports the display and editing   
          of arrays provided you have all the prerequisites.                    
                                                                                
          To display the first few elements of an array, place your cursor on   
          the array name and press INSert or = key. The INSert key will place   
          the array name in the storage window and the = key will show the      
          first member of the array at the bottom of the screen.                
                                                                                
          To change a specific element of an array use the storage window. For  
          example, if I had a BASIC array named XARRAY, a two dimensional array 
          of strings (XARRAY (5,5)) 6 elements of 6 strings each.  We will      
          ignore the zero position for simplicity.  Then it is 5 elements of 5  
          strings each starting with (1,1).  To modify the second string in the 
          third array, I would go to the storage window, enter XARRAY(3,2) to   
          display the string.  To change the contents, type over the data dis-  
          played.  You can change the hex or the ASCII interpretation.          
                                                                                
          Displaying the contents of an array will always show the element of   
          the array as it was type defined in the program. If the program was   
          4680/4690 BASIC and the array was not type defined, the result is a   
          BASIC real array. A BASIC Real number is binary coded decimal (BCD)   
          floating point form. Each number occupies 10 byte of memory. The      
          first byte is the sign and the exponent, the remaining nine bytes are 
          the mantissa.  Refer to the IBM 4680/4690 BASIC Language Reference    
          for more information on BASIC Real representation.                    
                                                                                
          For the debugger to display a C language array use square brackets.   
          For example, the previously mentioned XARRAY element in C is dis-     
          played by the command XARRAY[3][2].

          You can select variables to view or watch in the storage window with  
          the ShowVarPtsTo(*), PutVarInStg(INS), and PutVarPtsToInStg(Ctrl+Ins) 
          functions.                                                            
                                                                                
          If you have a variable in the storage window and you use the          
          PutVarInStg or Ins key to place a second variable in the window, the  
          first variable will be truncated to one line. If you want to see more 
          than one line of a variable displayed, it must be the last variable   
          in the window. Depending on format, the last variable can be viewed   
          on multiple pages.                                                    
                                                                                
          Arrays can be displayed in the data window. If you specify the array  
          name without an index, the debugger will display the entire array. By 
          using an index, the element of the array can be modified.  For more   
          information on arrays refer to "Array support" on page 24

          The options for formatting the display of a variable are:             
                                                                                
          HEX          Displays storage as a sequence of hexadecimal bytes.     
                                                                                
          CHAR         Displays a variable as a single ASCII character.

          The debugger supports chaining from one executable program to         
          another.  While debugging a chain command, a window will display      
          asking if you want to continue debugging the current application or   
          switch to the new application that was just started. To perform a     
          successful chain operation the files in both applications must be     
          correctly compiled and linked.                                        
                                                                                
          For more information on chaining programs refer to the IBM 4680/4690  
          BASIC Language Reference.                                             
                                                                                
          NOTE:  The debugger can only maintain control of one application.  If 
          you select to debug the new (chained to) application, you lose        
          debugger control of the old (chained from) application.

          The debugger can be run simultaneously in multiple sessions.  The     
          debugger can only run one session in the terminal.  Multiple con-     
          troller applications or a controller and a terminal application may   
          be run simultaneously.  Each debugger session requires a separate     
          command window.

          A simulated terminal off-line mode is available for debugging ter-    
          minal programs. You must be debugging a terminal application to use   
          this mode.                                                            
                                                                                
          Use the fast path letters CTF or the debugger (C)ommand pull-down     
          menu to set the off-line condition on the terminal, select the        
          (T)erminal status option, and select the terminal o(F)f-line option   
          on the terminal status menu.  While in the off-line mode, the ter-    
          minal cannot communicate with the controller except through debugger  
          control.                                                              
                                                                                
          Remember that debugger terminal off-line is a simulated condition and 
          may cause unpredictable errors when a terminal returns to the on-line 
          mode after an off-line debug session. This causes the terminal and

          The debug dump feature of the 4680/4690 Application Debugger allows a 
          user to recreate the application status at the time of an application 
          dump.                                                                 
                                                                                
          To debug an application dump, you first extract the application's     
          data from a dump using the program EXTRACT.286.  You then run the     
          debug dump program DEBUGDMP to analyze the application.  DEBUGDMP     
          comes in both an OS/2 version (DEBUGDMP.EXE) and a 4680/4690 version  
          (DEBUGDMP.286).                                                       
                                                                                
          For example, let's assume you are running two programs on the         
          4680/4690.  While running they both seem to hang intermittently. When 
          you detect a hang, dump the 4680/4690.  Run EXTRACT with the -QUERY   
          option on the terminal or controller dump just taken. This will list  
          the process names and identification numbers available for            
          extraction. Run EXTRACT and select one of the programs.  Then run     
          DEBUGDMP and select the extracted dump from the list.  If you have    
          correctly prepared your source code, you should now have DEBUGDMP     
          capability on the first program. Open another command window repeat   
          the EXTRACT to extract the second program.  By switching between the  
          windows, you can determine why the programs are hanging.              
                                                                                
          Special application dump routines are provided to help you with       
          debugging application problems. Refer to "Causing an application      
          dump" on page 31 for information on causing an application dump from  
          your program.                                                         
                                                                                
          For the application debug dump feature to be useful, you must have    
          the exact source and .CDV files for the application that dumped. If   
          the executable, source, and .CDV files don't match exactly, the       
          application dump feature may appear to work, but, the line number or  
          variable values could be incorrect. Minor changes in any of these     
          three files may cause major differences in the debug dump feature     
          output.                                                               
                                                                                
          The application dump screen is very similar to the debugger screen.   
          Certain debugger functions are not available, like run or single      
          step.

          The Debug Dump (DEBUGDMP) program must have the application dump data 
          extracted from the terminal or controller dump. To extract the data   
          and determine which application caused the dump use the EXTRACT       
          program. It consists of the files EXTRACT.286, EXT4680.286,           
          EXT4690.286, and EWTMSG.DAT.  These files are available on the        
          4680/4690 Application Debugger diskette.                              
          The extractor command syntax is:

          SYSTEM         required field, it must be 4680 or 4690.  Select 4680  
                         for 4680 OS controller dumps, and terminals dumps on   
                         468x HARDWARE.  Select 4690 for 4690 OS controller     
                         dumps, and terminals dumps on 469x HARDWARE.           
                                                                                
          TYPE           required field, it must be CONTROLLER or TERMINAL.     
                         This field identifies the type of dump you want to     
                         extract.  Only the first letter (T or C) is required.  
                                                                                
          NODE=??        Optional field, enter the node(??) of the controller   
                         that has the dump file on its disk.  An example is     
                         NODE=CC for the ADXLXCCN::  controller.  The default   
                         is the controller that initiated the EXTRACT program.  
                         You must not specify NODE or NODE=AA on a non-LAN      
                         system.                                                
                                                                                
          DIR=???        Optional field, enter the directory that contains the  
                         APPLDUMP file.  If the APPLDUMP file does not exist in 
                         the directory specified, it is created. If the         
                         APPLDUMP file exists, the new extracted dump will      
                         append to the file.  The default is the current direc- 
                         tory.                                                  
                                                                                
          -QUERY         Optional field, lists all applications present in the

                         name, the process ID, and the command line that        
                         started the process are listed.                        
                                                                                
          PROC=????      Optional field, extracts the process with the name     
                         '????'.  To obtain the correct PROCess name from a     
                         dump use the -QUERY option.  If multiple processes     
                         have the same name, only the first one is extracted.   
                                                                                
          PID=????       Optional field, extracts the process whose process ID  
                         is the hex number '????'.  To obtain the correct PID   
                         (Process IDentification) number for an application in  
                         a dump use the -QUERY option.                          
                                                                                
          EXTRACT extracts the necessary application information from the dump  
          and appends it to the APPLDUMP file. Make sure that the correct

          system .BSX files are available.  The BSX file required is            
          ADXCT4SY.BSX for controller dumps or ADXRT1SL.BSX for terminal dumps. 
          If the program that dumped was not an application, running EXTRACT    
          will not add an entry to the APPLDUMP file unless the PROC or PID     
          options are used to request a specific application.                   
                                                                                
          The application dump extractor uses ADX_SDT1:EWTPARM as a parameter   
          file for running in background. The -QUERY option is not valid in     
          background mode.                                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
          STARTING THE DEBUG DUMP PROGRAM                                       
                                                                                
          Before using the debug dump feature, a dump must have the necessary   
          data extracted. Refer to "Extracting a 4680/4690 dump" on page 29 for 
          more information.                                                     
                                                                                
          The debug dump command syntax is:

          OPTIONS        /C = force case sensitivity for variable names.        
                         /M = Use the Medium Memory model.                      
                                                                                
          DIRECTORY      optional field, enter the directory that contains the  
                         APPLDUMP file.  The default is the current directory.  
                                                                                
          DEBUGDMP displays a menu of the dump files ready for debug from the   
          APPLDUMP file.  Select the desired file and press enter. The next     
          screen will be a display of the source code associated with the       
          program that dumped.  The same rules apply to the DEBUGDMP as for     
          DEBUG. If you don't have a .CDV and source file(s) that match the     
          dump file, DEBUGDMP will not function correctly.                      
                                                                                
          The last line executed is automatically displayed. Use the memory     
          display capabilities and the Display Function Call Trace option to    
          diagnose the problem causing the dump.  Refer to Appendix D, "Debug   
          Dump Keys" on page 39 for information on active keys when using       
          DEBUGDMP.

          CAUSING AN APPLICATION DUMP                                           
                                                                                
          Remember to change your configuration in the terminal or controller   
          characteristics to take a dump when an application abends. Without an 
          application dump the dump debug feature is useless.                   
                                                                                
          One method of causing a controller or terminal to dump is to press    
          the dump button. The controller dump button is on the loop controller 
          card. The terminal dump switch is behind the cover on the right side  
          of the terminal.  Refer to the example in "Causing an application     
          dump" for information on dumping a hung application.  Extracting a    
          push button dump requires the use of the EXTRACT -QUERY option to     
          determine the application to extract from the dump.                   
                                                                                
          Special application dump facilities are provided to allow a 4680/4690 
          BASIC Application programmer to cause an application dump. They are   
          provided in linkable object files: EWTDUMPM for medium memory model   
          programs and EWTDUMPL for large memory model programs. These files    
          are included on the 4680/4690 Application Debugger diskette. To cause 
          a 4680/4690 BASIC application dump just call EWTDUMPM or EWTDUMPL     
          from your ON ERROR routine and include the correct object file when   
          you link your application.                                            
                                                                                
          Note: Do not use any parameters when you call EWTDUMPM or EWTDUMPL.   
                                                                                
          The previous method of causing a BASIC dump was to call ADXSERVE.     
          This method does not preserve the application stack in a format that  
          can be deciphered correctly by the application dump feature.          
          Debugger users should use the EWTDUMPM or EWTDUMPL calls.             
                                                                                
          Let's take an example of a divide by zero error that is               
          intermittently occurring in you BASIC program. You could go into the  
          ON ERROR routine and add an EWTDUMPL call in your divide by zero      
          error recovery routine.  Link with the EWTDUMPL.OBJ file. Then exer-  
          cise your program until the error occurs. After the application dump  
          is recorded to disk, use the extractor and the dump debugger to see   
          where the problem is occurring. This example could be used in a live  
          store, if the problem was very intermittent. The APPLDUMP file could  
          be retrieved to a host.  If the exact source and .CDV files are       
          available, the debug dump could be run on a controller or OS/2 PC at  
          the host site to determine the cause on the problem.                  
                                                                                
          C language programmers should cause a dump by storing data to a zero  
          pointer. This will cause a privilege violation and cause a dump.

  The following sections contain helpful hints, tips, and information per-

  contains problem determination hints and limitations.                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
  FINDING YOUR SOURCE AND OTHER FILES                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
  SOURCE FILES                                                                  
                                                                                
  The debugger searches in the following order for the source files that match  
  the target 286 file:                                                          
                                                                                
  1.  The path specified when invoking DEBUG, for example,                      
                                                                                
        DEBUG c:$test$myprog                                                    
                                                                                
  2.  The current directory                                                     
  3.  The environment variable (DEBUGSRC)                                       
  4.  The directories in the PATH environment variable.                         
                                                                                
  Use the DEBUGSRC environment variable for source files not in the same direc- 
  tory as the resulting object files or if the directory that is not in the     
  path environment variable.  Use the following example to set the DEBUGSRC     
  environment variable:                                                         
                                                                                
    DEFINE DEBUGSRC=C:$MYPROG$SRC                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
  EXECUTABLE FILES                                                              
                                                                                
  The debugger looks in the following places (in order) for the source files    
  that match the text contained in the target 286 file:                         
                                                                                
  1.  The path specified when invoking DEBUG, for example,

  2.  The current directory                                                     
  3.  The directories specified in the DEBUGSRC environment variable            
  4.  The directories in the PATH environment variable.

  FUNCTION CALL TRACE                                                           
                                                                                
  To display the program call stack (the Function Call Trace function), select  
  the display pull-down and the function call trace option.  This displays a    
  list of active function calls that show the route taken by the program to get 
  to the current place.  The debugger assumes a standard far call (four-byte)   
  using prologue and epilogues.  Each function executes the standard entry and  
  exit code at the top and bottom of the function.  Sample code for a function  
  without arguments follows:                                                    
                                                                                
    Top:                                                                        
      push  bp

    Bottom:                                                                     
      mov   sp,bp                                                               
      pop   bp                                                                  
      ret                                                                       
                                                                                
  NOTE:  If your function does not contain any automatic data, (data that       
  resides on the stack) then there may be no stack frame generated for that     
  function.  In that case, the debugger cannot include that function in its     
  call stack display.                                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
  SINGLE STEP DELAY                                                             
                                                                                
  If you single step across a source line that compiles into a lengthy set of   
  machine instructions, it may take a long time for that line to execute. The   
  debugger appears stopped or halted.  However, it is not stopped, it is single 
  stepping many instructions.                                                   
                                                                                
  If you single step across a source statement that causes an I/O operation, it 
  must complete this operation prior to the debugger regaining control.  If the 
  instruction requires input from the operator, you need to switch to the       
  application screen and supply that input.                                     
                                                                                
  If the application appears locked, press Ctrl+Break to stop execution.  If    
  the application is not waiting for an I/O or an OS routine, the debugger will 
  regain control.                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
  SINGLE STEP PROBLEMS                                                          
                                                                                
  If you are using "IF END#" or "ON ERROR GOTO" BASIC statements, you may have  
  problems with single step. These statements transfer control of the system    
  without returning. This sometimes causes the Debugger to appear hung during a 
  single step operation.  To stop after these statements, place a break point   
  after the label to which control may be transferred to by these statements.

  Several problems are caused by incorrect debugger installation.  The debugger 
  install program creates debugger logical names.  Therefore, the debugger will 
  not operate correctly unless the install program is used.  Refer to "Instal-  
  lation" on page 2 for information.                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
  ASSEMBLER SCREEN DISPLAYED                                                    
                                                                                
  If you invoke the debugger on your program and see assembly code instead of   
  your source code, there are several possible causes:                          
                                                                                
  1.  You did not compile and link your program with the correct options.  This 
      causes the debugger to use incorrect information.                         
                                                                                
  2.  The debugger cannot find the source file or .CDV file.  If using          
      4680/4690 BASIC, look for the .LCV file.  The .LCV file is created by the 
      DEBUGFRM program.                                                         
                                                                                
      NOTE:  The lower left corner of the debugger displays the source code     
      file name it tried to find.                                               
                                                                                
  3.  You have renamed a source file.                                           
                                                                                
      NOTE:  Check the lower left corner of the debugger for the name of the    
      source code the debugger is trying to use.                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
  UNABLE TO START SESSION ERROR                                                 
                                                                                
  This problem is usually caused by a back level of 4680/4690 OS installed.     
  Version 3 Release 1 Delta 1 (UR 32885) must be installed to run the debugger. 
                                                                                
  Insufficient memory available will cause similar indications.  Make sure that 
  enough memory is available to the debugger.                                   
                                                                                
  Another cause of this error is trying to run a background or terminal appli-  
  cation and not specifying the complete path name of the program when starting 
  the debugger. An example is using DEBUG /B BACKGRND instead of DEBUG /B

  UNABLE TO DISPLAY VARIABLE IN THE STORAGE WINDOW                              
                                                                                
  If you are having problems displaying variables by entering them in storage   
  window, check for proper scope of data. The debugger can only display vari-   
  ables within the scope of the executing program. Local variables and parame-  
  ters are only known within the routine where they are declared. These         
  variables only exist while the routine is active.                             
                                                                                
  Global variables may be local to the source module or may be known in all     
  modules. This depends on the way they were declared.                          
                                                                                
  BASIC global variables cannot be displayed unless the global variable is      
  actually used in the current source screen code.                              
                                                                                
  To display or scope a local variable with the debugger, display the source    
  code with the variable, place the cursor on the variable, and press the       
  INSert key.  The debugger will attempt to type define and locate the vari-    
  able.  If the variable cannot be found by the debugger, an error will show on 
  the message line.                                                             
                                                                                
  The rules for the declaration and scope of variables is beyond the range of   
  this manual.  Refer to the IBM 4680/4690 BASIC Language Reference under the   
  heading "Scope of Data" or your favorite programming manual for more informa- 
  tion on the definition and scope of variables.                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
  APPLICATION DEBUG DUMP GIVES INCORRECT RESULTS                                
                                                                                
  The .286, .CDV, and source files do not match exactly.                        
                                                                                
  For the application debug dump feature to be useful, you must have the exact  
  .286, .CDV and source files for the application that dumped. If the execut-   
  able, source, and .CDV files don't match exactly the application dump feature 
  may seem to work, but, the line number or variable values could be incorrect. 
  Minor changes in any of these three files may cause major differences in the  
  debug dump feature output. Remember that 4680/4690 BASIC files must have an   
  extension of .BAS to create and use an .LCV file as the source file.

  The 4680/4690 Application Debugger does not support the model 2 terminal.     
                                                                                
                                                                                
  UNABLE TO START HELP SESSION ERROR                                            
                                                                                
  The help session error is generally caused by the HELP: logical name incor-   
  rect or not defined. Check the controller user logical names configuration.   
                                                                                
  Another cause of this error is the HELP.286 file has been erased from the     
  SYSTEM: (ADX_SPGM) subdirectory. HELP.286 is the program the supports the     
  help function for the debugger. The .HLP files are the text files that        
  contain the information for the help screens.

  Help is not available when running debugger programs on OS/2. You will get    
  this error when starting the DEBUGDMP on OS/2.

  This is normal for continuation lines or multi-line statements. This problem  
  can occur if DEBUGFRM was not run on the source code or if a %NOLIST or       
  %DEBUG -V was included in the source code.                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
  UNABLE TO SEE THE CORRECT APPLICATION SCREEN                                  
                                                                                
  The 4680/4690 Application Debugger uses a virtual console. Many programs also 
  use a virtual console. The debugger will switch to the first available        
  virtual console. This may not be the application screen.                      
                                                                                
  If you have a FUNCTIONKEYS ON in your program, another virtual console is     
  created. This is usually the first console found by the debugger. To work     
  around this condition, set FUNCTIONKEYS OFF in your program until debugging   
  is complete.

  The string variable must be reformatted. Use the F9 key on the storage        
  screen. This is a normal for releases of 4680/4690 BASIC prior to Version 3.

  1.  Debugger cannot display an array of structures                            
      An array of structures is not supported by the debugger display routines. 
                                                                                
  2.  Debugger does not display certain variables.                              
      Some variables cannot be displayed by the debugger because of formatting  
      problems (ie bad structures, pointers, memory has been freed,...).        
                                                                                
  3.  Dump on Ctrl+Break:                                                       
      The following 4680/4690 OS fixes are available to fix this problem: V2R1  
      needs IR90805 on Delta 6 and V3 needs IR90807 on Delta 1.                 
                                                                                
  4.  Out of Memory:                                                            
      The application code must be post linked. This is especially true with    
      terminal code. If you receive a return code of C040400D, the terminal     
      that you are loading does not have sufficient memory for the debugger and 
      your application. Try reducing the number of applications to correct out  
      memory problems. In the terminal try reducing the size of the ram disk.   
                                                                                
  5.  Consoles:                                                                 
      Auxiliary console is not supported.                                       
                                                                                
  6.

      Some instructions will look like they accept a breakpoint, but, since no  
      code exists for that line of source code, the program will not stop at    
      the breakpoint. Some examples are the WEND, FOR or NEXT.  Set you break-  
      points at the previous or following instruction.                          
                                                                                
  7.  Function Call Trace:                                                      
      Some of the compilers will generate near calls for local functions.  This 
      creates a problem for the debugger while doing a Function Call Trace. If  
      you are having problems with this operation, try making your functions    
      external and recompiling.                                                 
                                                                                
  8.  ASCII interpretation:                                                     
      When using the variable window to display arrays or structures, an ASCII  
      interpretation may not be available on the right side. This occurs if the 
      element of the array or field name extends into the hex display area. To  
      see the ASCII interpretation display the specific element or specific     
      field.                                                                    
                                                                                
  9.  No help for DEBUGDMP on OS/2                                              
      The help facility is not available for DEBUGDMP when using it on OS/2.    
                                                                                
                                                                                
  DEBUGGER HINTS                                                                
                                                                                
  You can use the debugger to debug your user exit code without the application 
  source. For example, you can start the debugger using the name of the appli-  
  cation as the debugged program. This will start the application and the       
  assembler code for the application will display on the debugger display. Use  
  the fast path S and F and enter the name of you user exit. When you press     
  ENTER, the cursor will go to that function.  Then use C and C or F5 (Run to   
  Cursor) to run the program to the user exit selected. Use C and F (Single     
  Step into Function) or F2 to step into the user exit. Don't forget to switch  
  to the application (Ctrl+ALT+TAB) screen and supply the user input as         
  required by your application.  Ctrl+ALT+TAB will switch the display back to   
  the debugger screen.                                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
  IF YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM                                                      
                                                                                
  If you have a problem with the debugger, gather as much information as pos-   
  sible to help debug your problem. Save the source files and files created on  
  diskette.  Write down the command line parameters and as many of the symptoms 
  as possible. If the program causes a terminal or controller dump, save it to  
  diskette and copy the debug:debuglog (for the debugger) or the debug:addlog   
  (for the debug dump feature) file on the last diskette.  These steps will     
  help the debugger developers recreate and resolve your problem efficiently.

      DBGINFO will help the user debug problems with the linker debug informa-  
      tion. DBGINFO will format the .DBG file created by LINK86.  The linker    
      version that created the .DBG file is displayed. The module names are     
      displayed along with the lengths of the type information, symbol informa- 
      tion, line number, and public symbol sections.                            
                                                                                
      This information will allow the user to verify that the correct debug     
      information was created for a module that is being debugged.

  grams using OS/2 by renaming the BAS.BAT file to a BAS.CMD file, setting up   
  your OS/2 path to include the OS/2 executables, adding the include files used 
  in your program to the DPATH, and executing the BAS.CMD file.                 
                                                                                
  The debug dump feature (DEBUGDMP) will run on OS/2. You must have the         
  APPLDUMP file with the extracted dump, the correct .286 file, the matching    
  .CDV, and the matching source (.LCV for BASIC) file. The DEBUGDMP help        
  facility is not available on OS/2 the (F1) help key will not operate.

      This error will occur if the executable and source files do not match. It 
      is caused by changing the source files and not re-compiling or an old     
      level of source or executable in the search path. Correct this condition  
      and continue. If the problem persists, contact your IBM program support   
      representative.

      The debugger starts a separate program to handle help requests.  This     
      program could not be started.  The debugger will still work, but you will 
      not be able to see any help screens.  Check to verify that HELP.286 is in 
      the SYSTEM: (ADX_SPGM) subdirectory and the .HLP files are in the HELP:   
      (usually DEBUG) subdirectory.

      The debugger cannot find the variable name you entered.  It may be mis-   
      spelled, or the debugger may not have the necessary symbol information to 
      show this variable.
