\* PROGRAM OVERVIEW                                                          *
\*                                                                           *
\*  This Program is part of the Returns/Automatic Credit Claiming System     *
\*  and will be initiated daily via sleeper mode, or ad-hoc in command mode. *
\*  This program will run if the Chilled Foods Software is active or the     *
\*  Returns Software is active. The purpose of this program is to produce    *
\*  reports on Credit Claiming activity and to perform weekly housekeeping   *
\*  on Credit Claims files.                                                  *
\*                                                                           *
\*  If CHILLED FOODS ACTIVE then the Chilled Foods Wastage Report (CCCFW)    *
\*  will be produced daily from CCLAM and CCITF. This report shows totals    *
\*  of credit claimed for chilled foods wastage and the value of stock sold  *
\*  to staff from the Credit Claiming Control file (CCTRL), the difference   *
\*  between the above is calculated and displayed. Housekeeping of the       *
\*  Claims files is performed weekly, on a Sunday or on a subsequent day if  * !4.1BMG
\*  Sunday's housekeeping fails. The CCTRL file is updated to show the last  * !4.1BMG
\*  successful housekeeping date (weekly) and to reset the Staff Sales       *
\*  figure to zero (daily).                                                  *
\*                                                                           *
\*  If RETURNS IS ACTIVE then both reporting and housekeeping are performed  *
\*  weekly on a Sunday or subsequent day due to failure. The Claiming        * !4.1BMG
\*  activity shown in CCLAM and CCITF is reported in two reports, one a      *
\*  Summary report (CCSMY) and one a detailed report (CCDET). Each report    *
\*  shows Credit Claims data ordered by claim number within Business Centre. *
\*  In addition the detailed report shows Item level data for credit claimed.*
\*  Housekeeping is as for chilled foods, as is the CCTRL update.            *
\*                                                                           *
\*  If neither Chilled Foods nor Returns is active the no reporting or       *
\*  housekeeping takes place. The CCTRL Staff Sales value will still be      *
\*  reset to zero (daily).                                                   *
 \*                                                                           *

\*     Changed to include maintenance of the new Credit Claiming             *
\*     Stocktaking file (CCSTS) prior to Housekeeping when Returns is active *
\*     The CCSTS file will be updated with the latest credit claim numbers   *

\*     old that were despatched before the last run of PSS20 and have been   *

\*   Version 1.4       Rebecca Dakin              3rd February 1998          *
\*                                                                           *
\*     Changes have been made to make PSS20 Y2K compliant. DATE.LT, DATE.GE  *
\*     and DATE.GT have been used to handle the date comparisons from a      *
\*     function called CMPDATE.                                              *
\*     All code for Chilled Foods active has been removed from the program   *
\*     as it is now redundant.                                               *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 1.5       Amy Hoggard                 21st April 2000           *
\*    Changes for Internationalisation to call ADXSERVE to determine how     *
\*    many decimal places are in use.                                        *
\*                                                                           *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 1.6       Amy Hoggard                 19th May                  *
\*    Changes for Internationalisation to process new Business Centre        *
\*    Numbers as well as current letters.                                    *
\*    Also changed to call report descriptors from USERDESC in stead of      *
\*    hard coding them so USERDESC file needed for UK and Taiwan             *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 1.7       Julia Stones                30th June                 *
\*   Commented out the following change   - Change to categorise all         *
\*   non-alphabetic Business centres encountered to a single BC table record.*
\*   As non-alphabetic Business Centres now used for International processing*
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 1.8       Brian Greenfield         20th December 2000           *
\*   Re-jigged the logic to determine if the BC letter is valid or not.      *
\*   If the BC letter is not between A & Z or between 1 & 9 it sets it to    *
\*   ASCII value 91 (Don't ask me why, this is how it was before!)           *
\*   This is to stop the program falling over when it comes across a BC      *
\*   letter of SPACE in a CCLAM record, which is itself generated by a       *
\*   manual claim of an item not found on file.                              *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 1.9       Jamie Thorpe             24th November 2003           *
\*   Changed CCSMY reporting as part of the Credit Claiming Simplification   *
\*   project. The new style summary report will now be split in to 2 parts.  *
\*   The 1st section will detail any exception claims i.e. Any claims over of*
\*   a high value (as defined on the Software status file). The Claim number *
\*   reason code and value are detailed on the report.                       *
\*   The 2nd section will list each reason code for which a claim has been   *
\*   raised, along with the claim value.                                     *
\*   The new style report is switchable, this is determined by reading the   *
\*   CREDIT CLAIM record on softs Rec.43. If this is set to INACTIVE, then   *
\*   the report will still be created in the original format, otherwise it   *
\*   will be formatted in the new style.                                     *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 2.0       Jamie Thorpe             17th August 2004             *
\*   Small change to the report so that amounts BELOW £400 are reconciled    *
\*   rather than amounts ABOVE                                               *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 3.0      Julia Stones              24th November 2004           *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Changed all Integer 2 variables to Integer 4 (Store 7 have more than    *
\*   33,000 items to be reported on the detail report                        *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 4.1      Brian Greenfield          17th October 2007            *
\*   Changed to run reports on Sunday rather than Monday.                    *
\*                                                                           *
\*   Version 4.2      Harpal Matharu            27th January 2008            *
\*   A9B RETURNS @ POS                                                       *
\*   Changes made to the reports CCDET and CCSMY the store number is now     *
\*   will be added on the header of each page. If the claim is created by    *
\*   TILL the transaction number, till number and operator number will be    *
\*   added.                                                                  *
